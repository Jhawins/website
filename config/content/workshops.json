    "description": "Participants in this workshop will be handed a shifty looking baggie full of inexpensive parts which they will use to create their very own Arduino - compatible microcontroller board. While constructing the board, we’ll discuss & tinker with each component (clock source, power regulation, etc.) to see how they work. Then we’ll boot ‘em up & (provided the blue smoke hasn’t escaped by this point) start writing some code & talking to some devices."
